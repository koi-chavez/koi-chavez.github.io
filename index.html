  <ul>
  <li>Asteroids Project: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/Asteroids" target="blank">Click here to view!</a></li>
  <p>For this project our goal was to develop the 1979 classic arcade game, Asteroids. This project was programmed using Java and implemented using java data structures (such as ArrayList and loops). There was also a java GUI for the user to be able to play the game. I feel that this project helped me better understand the concepts and techniques of software design. We developed this game in different milestones and with each milestone we added a new layer of complexity to the game. We also used inheritance, interfaces and abstraction in our game. Being able to combine all of these to use in one project allowed me to really gain a better sense of how important these concepts are and how when they all are used together they can have powerful precedence in the code. <br> Additionally, I learned a lot about how to work individually. Knowing when to ask for help versus when to dig into a problem was an important skill learned during this assignment. I learned that sometimes asking for help or guidance on a problem can save you hours of pain.</p>
  <li>Chat Room Project: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/ChatRoom" target="blank">Click here to view!</a> </li>
  <p>For this project, the goal was to write a chatroom application that used both a client and server based on a protocol we determined as a class. The program has a client join the chatroom based off of their username, and then once the client has joined the session they can send a message For this assignment we had option to work with a partner, which I ended up doing. Because of this we split up the work based off of the client and server portions of this project. My partner wrote the client side code and I wrote the server side code. This project was a great learning experience because not only did we have to work together as a class to determine what our protocol for this project was going to be, we also had to work with a partner to make sure we were writing our code in a smart way to communicate with each other. This assignment helped me learn how to work both individually and in a group setting. </p>
  <li>Virtual Memory Manager: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/Virtual%20Memory%20Manager" target="blank">Click here to view!</a> </li>
  <p>The goal of this assignment was to  write a program that took in logical addresses and translated them to physical addresses for a virtual address space. This was done using a page table and a TLB (translation-lookaside-buffer) in C. I chose this assignment to be added to my portfolio because it helped me gain a better system level understanding of the computer. In my program we hard coded the TLB, but in normal computer systems the TLB is actually a set of hardware registers. I was able to learn more about what TLB does and why it is significant by being able to think through how to implement it in my own program. </p>
  <li>Pattern Lock Assignment: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/Pattern%20Lock" target="blank">Click here to view!</a> </li>
  <p> If you have ever owned or used an Android device, a lot of the lock screens will have nine vertices that a user then will draw a path on as the password to access the device. The goal of this assignment was to write a program using Python that would look for the longest path for a pattern lock using two different rules to decide if the path is valid. For this assignment we also had to apply permutations and use brute force to solve the problem. I have added this assignment as a part of my portfolio for two reasons. One, I really enjoyed coding this assignment. I sat down to start and I didn't get up until it was done because I was so intrigued by the problem and was enjoying coding it that I kept going until I was able to figure it out. I feel it allowed me to have my own creative twist on how I chose to solve the problem. The second reason is that I feel this assignment really helped me design an algorithm/process to solve the problem successfully. It was nice to take the topics we were learning in class and apply it to something that was a real world example of how these topics can be used. </p>
  <li>A* Algorithm: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/AStar%20Algorithm" target="blank">Click here to view!</a></li>
  <p>For this assignment, the goal was to implement the A* algorithm to solve a maze puzzle. This was another example of being able to take a topic (or in this case, algorithm) that we were learning in class and apply it to an example. It was a good learning experience being able to write the different functions of this program, from choosing the best way to implement the heuristic value to actually implementing the data structure in the code. </p>
  <li>Capstone Project: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/Capstone" target="blank">Click here to view!</a></li>
  <p>For my senior capstone project, I connected a USB web camera to a Raspberry Pi that allowed me to live stream and view the surveillance feed outside of the home network on a web application that I built. The purpose of this project is to show that modern-day video surveillance technologies can often be built at home for less cost than it would take to buy these technologies commercially. The code for my web application can be found by visiting the following link.</p>

  <li>Asteroids Project: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/Asteroids%20-%20CMPT%20202" target="blank">Click here to view!</a></li>
  <p>For this project our goal was to develop the 1979 classic arcade game, Asteroids. This project was programmed using Java and implemented using java data structures (such as ArrayList and loops). There was also a java GUI for the user to be able to play the game. I feel that this project helped me better understand the concepts and techniques of software design. We developed this game in different milestones and with each milestone we added a new layer of complexity to the game. We also used inheritance, interfaces and abstraction in our game. Being able to combine all of these to use in one project allowed me to really gain a better sense of how important these concepts are and how when they all are used together they can have powerful precedence in the code. <br> Additionally, I learned a lot about how to work individually. Knowing when to ask for help versus when to dig into a problem was an important skill learned during this assignment. I learned that sometimes asking for help or guidance on a problem can save you hours of pain.</p>
  <li>Chat Room Project: <a href="https://github.com/koi-chavez/senior-portfolio/tree/master/ChatRoom" target="blank">Click here to view!</a> </li>
  <p>For this project, the goal was to write a chatroom application that used both a client and server based on a protocol we determined as a class. The program has a client join the chatroom based off of their username, and then once the client has joined the session they can send a message For this assignment we had option to work with a partner, which I ended up doing. Because of this we split up the work based off of the client and server portions of this project. My partner wrote the client side code and I wrote the server side code. This project was a great learning experience because not only did we have to work together as a class to determine what our protocol for this project was going to be, we also had to work with a partner to make sure we were writing our code in a smart way to communicate with each other. This assignment helped me learn how to work both individually and in a group setting. </p>

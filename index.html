  <p>For this project our goal was to develop the 1979 classic arcade game, Asteroids. This project was programmed using Java and implemented using java data structures (such as ArrayList and loops). There was also a java GUI for the user to be able to play the game. I feel that this project helped me better understand the concepts and techniques of software design. We developed this game in different milestones and with each milestone we added a new layer of complexity to the game. We also used inheritance, interfaces and abstraction in our game. Being able to combine all of these to use in one project allowed me to really gain a better sense of how important these concepts are and how when they all are used together they can have powerful precedence in the code. Additionally, I learned a lot about how to work individually. Knowing when to ask for help versus when to dig into a problem was an important skill learned during this assignment. I learned that sometimes asking for help or guidance on a problem can save you hours of pain.</p>
